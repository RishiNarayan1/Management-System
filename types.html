            <h2>Solar Energy</h2>
            <p>Solar energy, as a renewable and sustainable resource, has emerged as a key player in the global transition toward cleaner and more environmentally friendly energy solutions. At its core, solar energy harnesses the abundant power of the sun to generate electricity and heat. The primary technology driving solar electricity generation is photovoltaic (PV) cells, which directly convert sunlight into electrical energy through the photovoltaic effect. These cells, often made of silicon, form solar panels that can be installed on rooftops, in solar farms, or integrated into various devices, providing a clean and efficient source of electricity.
                
                In addition to photovoltaics, solar thermal systems play a crucial role in utilizing the sun's heat for various applications. Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) systems, employing mirrors or lenses to focus sunlight, generate high temperatures that drive heat engines for electricity production. Moreover, solar thermal energy finds practical application in solar water heaters, contributing to residential and industrial heating needs. This dual approach, combining electricity generation and direct heating applications, showcases the versatility of solar energy technologies.</p>

            <h2>Wind Energy</h2>
            <ul>
                <p>Wind energy stands as a prominent pillar in the realm of renewable resources, capitalizing on the kinetic energy of moving air to generate electricity. The fundamental principle involves the conversion of the wind's kinetic energy into mechanical energy, which is then transformed into electrical power through the operation of wind turbines.

                    Wind turbines, the iconic structures often gracing landscapes, are comprised of rotor blades connected to a hub. As the wind blows, these blades rotate, activating a generator that produces electricity. The efficiency and output of wind turbines are influenced by factors such as wind speed, blade design, and the turbine's height. Modern turbines are designed to capture the maximum energy from the wind and are often grouped together in wind farms to scale up power generation.</p>

            <h2>Water Energy</h2>
            <p>Water energy, manifested through hydropower, has long been a cornerstone of renewable energy. The conventional approach to hydropower involves the construction of dams, creating reservoirs that serve as controlled sources of flowing water. As water is released through turbines, the kinetic energy is converted into electricity, offering a reliable and consistent power source. Projects range in size from small-scale dams supporting local communities to colossal structures like the Three Gorges Dam in China, highlighting the adaptability of hydropower to diverse energy needs.

                Run-of-river hydropower presents a different facet of water energy utilization. Unlike traditional dams, run-of-river systems harness the natural flow of rivers without extensive water storage. By diverting a portion of the river's flow through turbines, these systems generate electricity while minimizing the environmental impact associated with large reservoirs. This approach underscores the synergy between energy generation and environmental conservation.</p>
